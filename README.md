ENGR 697: Senior Capstone Project
San Francisco State University
Spring 2023
Section 4

-------------------------------------------------------------------
I have attached all the files used for my portion of the project. For example, the websocket server, http server, html files, and etc.
Because the website runs on a local network on my computer, you won't have access to it. So instead I attached screenots.
I apologize for the main repositiory name. I kept making changes and moving files in different places to ensure I had working code and that I didn't lose it.
