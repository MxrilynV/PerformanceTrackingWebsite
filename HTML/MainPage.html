            <p>
                With the rise in popularity of rowing machines due to their numerous health benefits, it is important to <br>
                address the risks of injury associated with rowing exercises. Through our research, we found that existing <br>
                gym apps mostly offer pre-set luxuries, such as video training, meal plans, and workout tracking, but do <br>
                not provide real-time personal statistics for weight lifting or ensure the safety of the user. While we <br>
                discovered a similar approach to our design in other implementations such as, flex, it does not prioritize <br>
                user safety. This led us to conclude that rowers should be able to safely row without the worry of injury <br>
                and have their performance tracked to better understand their progress and have the correct amount of training. <br>
                To achieve our objectives, my team and I are designing an application and system that fully encompasses the <br>
                needs of rowers and ensures their safety. Our project involves calculating the weight, power, distance of the <br>
                bar traveled, and velocity, while also ensuring the user is using the equipment safely. Our first step in the <br>
                design phase was finding a standard rowing machine that is commonly used through many gyms. Which led us to the <br>
                Concept2 Model D Indoor Rowing Machine, that was provided by San Francisco Stateâ€™s Athletic Department. Looking <br>
                at the mechanical components of the Concept 2 Rowing Machine and understanding the way it functions, we were able <br>
                to identified the necessary sensors and programming needed to collect and display the desired statistics in real-time <br>

        <p><b>Project Goal</b></p>
        <div class="box"> <p>
            The objective of this project is to enhance gym-goers' workout experience by enabling them to monitor their <br>
            performance in real-time while using exercise equipment. To achieve this, we propose to develop an additional <br>
            device that works in tandem with equipment such as lifting and rowing machines, providing users with immediate <br>
            performance feedback. The collection of data from exercise equipment has been shown to have numerous benefits, <br>
            including tracking performance over time, setting achievable goals, promoting self-motivation, ensuring proper <br>
            equipment use for safety, and improving overall experience.
